Brief Summary:

Three surprises about chance:

There are three main factor plays best role. These are:

* Rider
* Elephant
* Path

In this metaphor rider is our mind, elephant is emotions and path is environment.

1) Direct the Rider

Rider is basically our mind or thinking mechanism. And sometimes it can stick in some circumstances. So rider need to see the bright spot. But rider does not have all the power.

2) Motivate the Elephant

When the elephant wants to do something or doesnâ€™t want to move then, even rider can see the exit of situation, Elephant will have the control. So that, elephant need to be motivated to do what rider says.

3) Shape the path

Without the path, the rider might go wrong path and might give up!

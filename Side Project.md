### Nasa Wearable technologits CO2 analysis

- Analyzed the datasets from IOT devices on the International Space Station and predicted anomalies in CO2 levels. Built an anomaly detection model and forcasting with LSTM and fully connected networks.  
- Created interface for ISS crew members to help with future anlysis.
- Presented a poster at the NASA Wearable Technologies Workshop on April, 2018.

### MLRPRO 

Online resume processing application using machine learning algorithms

Our machine learning system uses unsupervised learning algorithms to cluster resumes of top software engineers in various companies and label their skills accordingly. Next, the user uploads their resume and it is tested against the predicted hypothesis by the ML algorithms which in hand return what tier(s) you belong to. As for tiers, we divided them into two parts. Top tier, such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM, etc..., and bottom tier such as local Houston companies. Unfortunately, due to time constraints we cannot provide company specific statistics according to ones resume. (We plan to offer location based ranking and statistics in the future). Another factor we included was education and improvement. After viewing the results, users can follow recommended links provided to websites where they can practice on algorithms or take online certifications that can help them stand out even further!

### Intelligent Lock

Developed a smart door lock project which uses face recognition plus liveness of images. It uses 3d convolution to determine the liveness, then the landmark model to find out who is it in the video input.

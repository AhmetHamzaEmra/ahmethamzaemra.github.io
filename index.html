author: Ahmet Hamza Emra
date: April 2020
abstract: In 1995 one hot summer day, I was born in Eskisehir/Turkey. Since then, I have been doing stupid things and learning new things. These days, I am working as Data scientist. Its a quite nice topic to work if you ask me. I like math, puzzles, boardgames and poems.

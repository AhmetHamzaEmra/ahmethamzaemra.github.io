title: Story of Something Good (I hope)
author: Ahmet Hamza Emra
abstract: In 1995 one hot summer day, I was born in Eskisehir/Turkey. Since then, I have been doing stupid things and learning new things. These days, I am working as Data scientist. Its a quite nice topic to work if you ask me. I like math, puzzles, boardgames and poems.

    <p class="BodyText">
        I am currently working for Pfizer as Data Scientist. I work on forcasting models to improve and optimize production.
         My main interest is reinforcement learning. I like training models to solve real life problems (mode fun when they are wierd problems).

        Also, I have my own company called NoArgue where we make movie, music and restaurant recommendations for groups. <a href="https://www.noargue.com">Check out NoArgue</a>
